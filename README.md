# Immo-Eliza

Immo Eliza is a Python project using web scraping to create a dataset of Belgian real estate sales data.


# Context
I used immoweb real estate company and looked for properties for sale across Belgium.

Currently, the program attempts to pull the following information (stored in the dataset):

Locality  
Type of property (House/apartment)  
Subtype of property (Bungalow, Chalet, Mansion, ...)  
Price  
Build year  
Renovation year  
Living Area  
Terrace (Yes/No)  
If yes: Area  
Garden (Yes/No)  
If yes: Area  
Surface area of the plot of land   
Number of facades  

As of yet, not all variables have been able to be correctly scraped. In its current state the script accurately returns:  
✔️Locality  
✔️Type of property (House/apartment)  
✔️Subtype of property (Bungalow, Chalet, Mansion, ...)  
✔️Price
Future updates will be made to complete the full scraping dataset.
